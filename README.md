# The Labor and Educational Effects of DACA: Evidence from California

TL;DR: DACA-eligible individuals post-implementation show improved labor outcomes, working more hours and earning higher incomes, with reduced self-employment. However, there's no change in unemployment. GED attainment doesn't increase, but there's a slight rise in college attendance, possibly due to policies like the California Dream Act. This indicates DACA recipients invest in education despite program uncertainties.
